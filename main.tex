\section*{Abstract}
The open-source ecosystem is the innovation driver of modern software engineering, and learning about open-source values and practices is of great significance to developers. This course report presents our team's analysis of the entire process from contributors' workflows to the acceptance of contributions, with actual contributions made in the open-source project \texttt{Python-Scripts}. 

We first investigated the meaning and value of open source, elaborating on different types of open-source licenses, followed by an analysis of governance models and contribution processes within the open-source community. Based on this research, we explored real-world open-source processes through practice. In our contribution plan, all four team members collaborated by enhancing code and documentation for the open-source project while dividing tasks related to this report's content. 

We submitted a pull request to the \texttt{Python-Scripts} repository, contributing beginner-friendly Python scripts with practical functionality and improving the project’s documentation. Our contributions are currently under review by the maintainers. Through this process, we demonstrated effective teamwork and gained valuable experience in open-source collaboration.

% 1. Introduction
% -------------------
\section{Introduction}
Open source software is a pillar of modern engineering practice, providing publicly auditable codebases and an active peer review process. Contributing to the open source community allows developers to gain practical experience in version control, issue categorization, continuous integration, and distributed collaboration. In this report, our team selected the \texttt{Python-Scripts} project. 

\texttt{Python-Scripts} is a community-maintained repository that brings together over 60 independent Python tools, each located in its own folder with explanatory README files. The project uses the MIT license, has over 700 GitHub stars, and is tagged with labels suitable for beginners (such as "good-first-issue"). 

We chose it for three reasons: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Technical scope fit:} The repository covers file input/output, web automation, and simple machine learning demonstrations—technologies we have encountered in our course.
    \item \textbf{Low entry barrier:} The modular folder structure allows newcomers to add or optimize individual scripts without deep coupling with the rest of the codebase.
    \item \textbf{Responsive maintainers:} Historical PR data shows shorter review cycles which significantly increases the likelihood of our contributions being merged and available for evaluation verification.
\end{itemize}

% 2. Open Source Investigation
% -------------------------------
\section{Open Source Investigation}

\subsection{Understanding the Open Source Community}
We studied the philosophy behind open source: transparency, collaboration, and community.

\subsection{Open Source Licenses}
The key licenses we investigated include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{MIT License}: Highly permissive, allows reuse with attribution.
    \item \textbf{GPLv3}: Requires derivative works to remain open.
    \item \textbf{Apache 2.0}: Includes explicit patent grants.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ways to Contribute}
Common contribution types include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Code (features, bug fixes)
    \item Documentation (guides, tutorials)
    \item Bug reports and issue triage
    \item Community support and moderation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Finding Suitable Projects}
We explored GitHub, filtering projects with labels such as \texttt{good first issue} and \texttt{help wanted}. Tools like \texttt{firstcontributions.github.io} were also helpful.

\subsection{Typical Contribution Process}
The typical process includes:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Fork the repository
    \item Clone to local machine
    \item Create a feature branch
    \item Commit and push changes
    \item Open a pull request
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Contribute to \texttt{Python-Scripts}}

% 3. Contribution Plan
% ----------------------
\section{Contribution Plan}

Our group has decided that the team leader will be responsible for coordinating the documentation plan and scheduling, as well as facilitating thorough discussions with all members to select an open-source project for contribution. Each team member will make contributions through their own local repositories after forking the selected project, and a single pull request will be submitted on behalf of the entire group. The specific division of tasks among our members is as follows.

\begin{longtable}{|p{3cm}|p{7cm}|p{3cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Name} & \textbf{Task} & \textbf{Status} \\
\hline
 & Coordinate scheduling, write abstracts/plans/conclusions, final layout, final contribution & Pending \\
\hline
 & License, community ecosystem, contribution process description & Pending \\
\hline
 & sample & Pending \\

\end{longtable}

% 4. Implementation
% ----------------------
\section{Implementation}

We followed a collaborative workflow using GitHub:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Forked the upstream repository
    \item Cloned and created local branches
    \item Used VS Code, pytest, and Markdown tools for implementation
    \item Opened pull requests with detailed descriptions and commit messages
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}

Our contributions include:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Pull Request \#101: Bug fix in `api.py` — \url{https://github.com/example/project/pull/101}
%     \item Pull Request \#102: Improved documentation — \url{https://github.com/example/project/pull/102}
% \end{itemize}

% 6. Discussion
% ----------------------
\section{Discussion}

Contributing to a real-world project gave us first-hand experience with open-source collaboration. We received valuable feedback from the maintainer. One PR was merged within 24 hours, while another received comments suggesting improvements. We learned the importance of clear communication, readable code, and community etiquette.

% ----------------------
% 7. Conclusion
% ----------------------
\section{Conclusion}
In this project, our team first collaborated to complete a survey of open source contributions, including the significance of open source and how to become an open source contributor. Then we selected an actual meaningful open source project \texttt{Python-Scripts}, and actually contributed to the project. Through this course, we learned Git skills and the standard contribution process, and learned how to use git for team collaboration. We plan to continue to pay attention to open source projects outside of this course and continue to contribute.
